# Klari 4 Discord
An intelligent bot built to assist management of a Discord server.

Klari uses Node.js as its primary method of communication to the Discord API.
(There are currently no plans to revise the code for use amongst other servers.)

To interface with Klari on the discord server, all commands are prefaced with ```kshell>```.
All available commands are created under the ```shell_commands``` folder as separate files containing the javascript code for that command.

```kshell>reload (command)``` is useful for reloading/loading your custom command on the discord server *without* having to restart the bot.

If you wish to join the designated Discord server for which Klari will run (for now), we welcome you with open arms.
