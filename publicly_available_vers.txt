if(!msg.guild.channels.find('name', 'foo') {
    msg.channel.sendMessage('Please create a channel by the name of \'foo\'');
}

well then i'll have it so the public version can be configured from any channel
any as in
like
private moderator channels
or something

or you can make the command that configures the bot available for mods only

wait you can have commands that only execute when the user has a specific role?
